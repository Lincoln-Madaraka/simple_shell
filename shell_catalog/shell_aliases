alias: alias
       Define or display aliases.

    Without any  arguments, `alias' prints  list of aliases in reusable
    form `alias NAME=VALUE' on stdout

    Else, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given.
    A trailing space in VALUE causes the next subject  to be checked for
    alias substitution when the alias is increased in size

    Options:
	NONE
    Exit Status:
    alias returns true except when a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been defnd
